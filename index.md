bcraft discord js yada yada yada

# Install
- install nodejs (latest lts should be perfectly fine)
> ur friendly reminder that a nodejs install with build tools takes quite a lot of spaces on ur drive (more than 10gb) (if you arent surprised then why are you here lol). so if node ask to install buildtools just uh deny
- download this repo (the big green button that says `Code` -> `Download ZIP`)
- extract
- open a terminal in that folder and do `npm install`
- after installing do `node index.js`
> first time running it will complain about config.json (duh obviously else what will it do without any bot credentials. just open `config.json` in the folder then fill in the blank.)

> where to get credentials? [discord developers panel](https://discord.com/developers/application). more instruction go google or bing or something. just note that dont leak ur bot's credentials (you have been warned) (discord is rlly quick if you accidentally post a token **publicly** and revoke that token. dont ask why i know)
- to run the bot `node index.js` is your friend

## Updating commands (sync commands to guilds)
- run `node syncCommands.js`
